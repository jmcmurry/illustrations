# Illustrations, primarily for the [Monarch Initiative](http://monarch-initiative.org)

Figures that may end up in grants and papers get published here first (at a minimum) so that we are not restricted from using them in the future.

Figures in this repository are licensed as CC-BY 4.0 (see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md); however, I've made many more generic illustrations, icons, etc  available under public domain at [https://pixabay.com/en/users/mcmurryjulie-2375405/](http://bit.ly/pixabay-mcmurryjulie). No permission is needed for those in pixabay; however, we do ask permission to use for figures here as they're more specific to the domain of translational research and a lot of effort has gone into them. To request permission, please contact us via our public gitter room https://gitter.im/monarch-initiative/helpdesk, direct message me @figgyjam, or just [log a ticket](https://github.com/jmcmurry/illustrations/).
