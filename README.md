# Illustrations, primarily for the [Monarch Initiative](http://monarch-initiative.org)

Figures that may eventually end up in other places get published here first (at a minimum) primarily so that we ourselves are not restricted from using them or adaptations of them in the future. CC Licenses are non-revokable.

Figures in this repository are licensed as **CC-BY 4.0** (see [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/jmcmurry/open-illustrations/blob/master/LICENSE.MD); no permission is needed to use or adapt them. However, attribution is required as per best practice for [how to attribute CC licensed work](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution#This_is_an_ideal_attribution). For example:

["Uberon Species"](https://github.com/jmcmurry/open-illustrations/blob/master/figures/uberon_species_views_2017-02-27a.pdf) by Julie McMurry [(@figgyjam)](https://twitter.com/figgyjam) is licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://github.com/jmcmurry/open-illustrations/blob/master/LICENSE.MD)

While I can not legally require it by the CC-BY 4.0 license, I always appreciate knowing how these images are used, and attribution alone will not achieve that. To signal your use or adaptation of these images (note no permission is required), please contact me via the Monarch public gitter room https://gitter.im/monarch-initiative/helpdesk, direct message me [@figgyjam](https://twitter.com/figgyjam),  [log a ticket](https://github.com/jmcmurry/illustrations/) or make a pull request on the [list of uses](https://github.com/jmcmurry/open-illustrations/blob/master/figures/reuses.md). In other words, whatever method you prefer.

Pull requests for any edits or altered copies are of course welcomed.
